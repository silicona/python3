'''
Pociones:
    -v: gives more verbose output, including the names of the tests being executed.
    -s or -nocapture: allows output of print statements, which are normally captured and hidden while executing tests. Useful for debugging.
    --nologcapture: allows output of logging information.
    --rednose: an optional plugin, which can be downloaded here, but provides colored output for the tests.
    --tags=TAGS: allows you to place an @TAG above a specific test to only execute those, rather than the entire test suite.
